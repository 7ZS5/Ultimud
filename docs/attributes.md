### Multipliers:

For every certain amount of points you put into a stat, a multiplier is applied to the attribute you have put points into.

For example look at this template of a starter character at level 1.

Power: 3 x1
Endurance: 3 x1 
Vitality: 3 x1
Accuracy: 3 x1
Reflex: 3 x1
Precision: 3 x1
Stamina: 3 x1
Knowledge: 3 x1
Focus: 3 x1
Wisdom: 3 x1

All of their stats are below 8 so they only have a x1 multiplier.
However, we will update some stats and then see what happens.

Power: 8 x2
Endurance: 5 x1 
Vitality: 6 x1
Accuracy: 4 x1
Reflex: 3 x1
Precision: 3 x1
Stamina: 9 x2
Knowledge: 3 x1
Focus: 3 x1
Wisdom: 4 x1

Power and stamina recieved a multipier because it reached 8 points.
The trend continues onward each time, but as you level up, the requirement gets higher.
