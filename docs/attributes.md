### Multipliers:

For every certain amount of points you put into a stat, a multiplier is applied to the attribute you have put points into.
For example look at this template of a starter character at level 1.
All of their stats are below 8 so they only have a x0.1 multiplier.
However, we will update some stats and then see what happens.

- Power: 3 x0.1
- Endurance: 3 x0.1
- Vitality: 3 x0.1
- Accuracy: 3 x0.1
- Reflex: 3 x0.1
- Precision: 3 x0.1
- Stamina: 3 x0.1
- Knowledge: 3 x0.1
- Focus: 3 x0.1
- Wisdom: 3 x0.1

Power and stamina recieved a multipier because it reached 8 points.
The trend continues onward each time, but as you level up, the requirement gets higher.

- Power: 8 x0.3
- Endurance: 5 x0.1
- Vitality: 6 x0.1
- Accuracy: 4 x0.1
- Reflex: 3 x0.1
- Precision: 3 x0.1
- Stamina: 9 x0.3
- Knowledge: 3 x0.1
- Focus: 3 x0.1
- Wisdom: 4 x0.1
